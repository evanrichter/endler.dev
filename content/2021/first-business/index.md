One of the best decisions I made in 2020 was to open [my
calendar](https://booktime.xyz/p/matthias) to everyone. People book
appointments to chat about open-source projects, content creation, and business
ideas.

When we talk about business ideas, people usually gravitate towards problems
suitable for startups. Things like using artificial intelligence to find
clothes that fit or building a crowdfunding platform on the blockchain.

These are all great ideas, but they require lots of persistence and deep
pockets.

In reality, most people just want something cool to work on and happy customers.
It turns out, you don't have to run a startup for that. Instead, starting a side
project is less risky and can grow organically into a business over time.

Usually, the solution is right in front of them: in some Excel spreadsheet on
their computer.

## I Hate Excel

I never spend more time in Excel than I absolutely have to. Normally, I need to
get something done quickly. I don't care about the layout or the design; I care
about getting over it. Probably [I'd pay someone to do that work for
me](/2018/excel/) &mdash; and that's my point!

The spreadsheets and lists you create for your own solve a real problem you
face. Chances are, someone else has the same problem. That's a business
opportunity!

It ticks all the boxes:

- [x] Solves a real problem.
- [x] It's boring, so people might pay for not having to do it themselves.
- [x] No time wasted on design or infrastructure. It's the ultimate MVP.
- [x] Low tech: no programming required.
- [x] You spend less time building and more time talking to potential customers.

## Examples

A few years ago, I looked for static code analysis tools. I did some boring
research, [started a list](/2017/obsolete), pushed it to Github, and that's
it. Fast forward a few years, and that side project is pulling in money from
sponsors and attracts consulting gigs.

Another example: a guy built a spreadsheet for places to work from remotely. He shared the
spreadsheet on Twitter. People added more places, and he created a website from
it. The website is [NomadList](https://nomadlist.com/), and the guy is [Pieter
Levels](https://levels.io/). He pulls in 300k/year from that website.

**I left a spot for your story here.** Now brush up that spreadsheet (or that
list), share it with your friends, iterate on their feedback, and build your
first business.
