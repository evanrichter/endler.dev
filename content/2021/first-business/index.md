One of the best decisions I made in 2020 was to open [my
calendar](https://calendly.com/matthias-endler) to everyone.

Interesting people book appointments to chat about open-source projects, content
creation, and business ideas.

When we talk about business ideas, people usually gravitate towards
problems suitable for startups.

I think that's because of [survivorship
bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) from seeing all the
hyper-successful billion-dollar unicorns we see on the web and on TV these days.
They cure cancer and disrupt the global retail market with AI.

The problem with startups is that they usually fail. Startups only work at scale
and to reach scale you have to grow a lot, which is hard.

Most people I talk to don't run any business at all. What they want is
something fun to work on and happy customers. Turns out you don't have to run a
startup for that. Starting a side project is less risky and can evolve into
something bigger over time.

Usually the solution is right in front of them: in some Excel sheet on their computer.

## I Hate Excel

I never spend more time in Excel than I absolutely have to. Usually I need to
get something done quick. I don't care about the layout or the design. I care
about getting over it. Probably I'd pay someone to do that work for me &mdash;
and that's my point!

The spreadsheets and lists you create for your own solve a real problem you
face. Chances are, someone else has the same problem. That's a business
opportunity!

It ticks all the boxes:

- [x] Solves a real problem.
- [x] It's boring, so people might pay for not having to do it themselves.
- [x] No time wasted on design or infrastructure. It's the ultimate MVP.
- [x] You spend less time building and more time talking to potential customers.

## Examples

A few years ago I looked for static code analysis tools. I did some boring
research, [I started a list](/2017/obsolete), pushed it to Github and that's it. Fast forward a few
years and that side project is pulling in money from sponsors and attracts consulting
gigs.

A guy built a spreadsheet of places to work from remotely. He shared the spreadsheet on Twitter.
People added more places and he created a website from it. The website is
[NomadList](https://nomadlist.com/) and the guy is [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/). He pulls in 300k/year from that website.

> Instead of building a site first, I simply made public Google spreadsheet to collect the first data and see if thereâ€™d be interest for this at all. &mdash; Pieter Levels

In the early days, [Zalando](https://zalando.com) didn't have a backend. New
orders were simply inserted into a spreadsheet. The company probably had
hundreds of customers before they replaced it with a proper database.
(I heard that story at codetalks years ago, but I can't find a link to the recording.)

I left a spot for your story here. Now dig up that spreadsheet, share it with
your friends, iterate on their feedback and build your first business.
