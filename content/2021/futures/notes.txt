If you're starting out with async in Rust
you might be surprised that your code is actually quite... slow.

Running futures in parallel (not concurrently)


Joined futures will run concurrently, NOT in parallel

you have to spawn tasks yourself


You can spawn both, then await both.

let t1 = tokio::spawn(run_stream(client.clone()));
let t2 = tokio::spawn(run_stream(client.clone()));
t1.await;
t2.await;

Alternative par_stream
