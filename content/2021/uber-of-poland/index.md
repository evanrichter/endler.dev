A few years ago I was visiting a friend in Warsaw, Poland. With a local guide, I
was able to get a glimpse into the lifestyle of young people. One thing I
noticed was that cabs were relatively expensive and there was no Uber available.
It turned out that most young people instead used a community-operated service
called _Nightrider_.

I couldn't find anything about it on the web, so I decided to write about it so
that the service wouldn't be forgotten.

## Delightfully Low-Tech

What fascinated me about _Nightrider_ was the way the service worked &mdash;
completely via WhatsApp: you wrote a message in a group chat and one of the free
riders replied with a thumbs-up emoji, and everyone involved knew the ride was
scheduled.

In these days of venture-backed startups that need millions in capital before
they turn a profit, this approach is delightfully efficient. Basically, they
built on an existing infrastructure having to create their own ride-hailing
platform, sign-up process, or even website.

The service would grow solely by word of mouth. Using existing infrastructure
meant that it was very cheap to run and there were very low upfront costs with
[zero lines of code to write](/2021/first-business/).

It simply solves the customer's problem in the most straightforward way
possible. Of course, there are legal issues regarding data protection, labor
law or payment processing, but the important bit is that they had paying
customers from day one.
The rest is easier to solve than a lack of product market fit.

## In Defense of Clones

Uber and Lyft can't be everywhere from the start. While they expand their
businesses, others have the ability to be faster. There's an Uber clone in China
([DiDi](https://didichuxing.com])) and one in Africa and the Middle East
([Careem](https://www.careem.com/en-ae/)) and basically one for every

[the](https://taxi.yandex.ru/) [world](https://www.gojek.com/). The western
world rarely speaks about those "Ubers of X", but they serve millions of
customers. While they start as exact copies of their well-known counterparts,
some of them end up offering better service, because they understand the local
market.

## People always find a way

With creativity, you can provide great service even when the odds are against
you. If there's a market, there's a way. The Cubans have a word for it:
[_resolver_](https://medium.com/@d.yau/cubas-resolver-mentality-makes-it-the-next-startup-hub-2f10ea2096a0),
which means "we'll figure it out".
