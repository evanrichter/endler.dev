A couple of years ago, I was visiting a friend in Warsaw, Poland. Having a local
guide meant that I could get a glimpse into young people's lifestyle at the
time. One thing I noticed was that Taxis were relatively expensive and there was no
Uber. It turns out that most young people used a community-operated
service called _Nightrider_ instead.

I couldn't find anything about it on the Internet, so I decided to write this
post so that the service wouldn't be forgotten.

What fascinated me about _Nightrider_ was how the service operated &mdash; entirely
through WhatsApp: You would write a message in a group chat and one of the free
riders would respond with a thumbs-up emoji , and everyone involved knew that
the ride was scheduled.

In times of venture-backed startups that need millions of capital before
turning any profit, this approach is delightfully efficient. Basically, they were
just piggy-backing on existing infrastructure without having to build a custom
scheduling network, a sign-up process or even a website.

The service would grow entirely through word of mouth. Using existing
infrastructure meant that operations was very cheap and there were very little
upfront costs with **zero lines of code to be written**.

It just solves the customer's problem in the most low-tech way possible.

## In Defense of Clones

Uber and Lyft can't be everywhere from the start. While they grow their
business, others have the opportunity to be faster. There's an Uber clone in
China ([DiDi](https://didichuxing.com])) and one in Africa and the Middle East
([Careem](https://www.careem.com/en-ae/)) and basically one for every
[country](https://gett.com/il/)

[the](https://taxi.yandex.ru/) [world](https://www.gojek.com/). The western
world rarely speaks about those "Ubers of X", but they handle millions of customers. While
they might start as an exact copy of their well-known counterparts, some of them
end up providing better service, because they understand the local market.

## People always find a way

With creativity, you can provide great service even if the odds are against you.
If there's a market, there's a way. The Cubans have a word for it: [_resolver_](https://medium.com/@d.yau/cubas-resolver-mentality-makes-it-the-next-startup-hub-2f10ea2096a0),
which means "we'll figure it out".
