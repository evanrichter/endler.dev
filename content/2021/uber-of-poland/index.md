A few years ago I visited a friend in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland. As we explored the
city, one thing I noticed was that cabs were relatively expensive and there was
no Uber. Instead, most (young) people used a community-organized service called
_Night Riders_.

I couldn't find anything about that service on the web, so I decided to write
about it to preserve its history.

## Delightfully Low-Tech

What fascinated me about _Night Riders_ was the way the service operated &mdash;
completely via WhatsApp: you post a message in a group chat and one of the free
riders would reply with a üëç emoji. With that, your ride was scheduled.
You'd pay through PayPal or cash.

In these days of venture-backed startups that need millions in capital before
they turn a profit, this approach is decidedly antagonistic. Basically,
_Night Riders_ built on top of existing infrastructure instead of maintaining their
own ride-hailing platform, sign-up process, or even website.

The service would grow solely by word of mouth. Using existing infrastructure
meant that it was extremely cheap to run and there were almost zero upfront costs without
[a single line of code to write](/2021/first-business/).

It simply solved the customer's problem in the most straightforward way
possible. Of course, there are legal issues regarding data protection, labor
law or payment processing, but the important bit is that they had paying
customers from day one.
The rest is easier to solve than a lack of product market fit.

## In Defense of Clones

Uber and Lyft can't be everywhere from the start. While they expand their
businesses, others have the ability to outpace them. There's an Uber clone in
China ([DiDi](https://didichuxing.com)), one in Africa and the Middle East
([Careem](https://www.careem.com/en-ae/)) and basically one for every
[country](https://gett.com/il/)

[the](https://taxi.yandex.ru/) [world](https://www.gojek.com/). The tech
industry rarely talks about these *Ubers of X*, but they serve millions of
customers. While they start as exact copies of their well-known counterparts,
some of them end up offering better service thanks to their understanding of the
local market.

## People always find a way

With creativity, you can provide great service even without a big budget.  The
important part is to know which corners you can cut while staying true to your
mission. If there's a market, there's a way. The Cubans have a word for it:
[_resolver_](https://medium.com/@d.yau/cubas-resolver-mentality-makes-it-the-next-startup-hub-2f10ea2096a0),
which means "we'll figure it out".
