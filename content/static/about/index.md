Warm welcome to my blog! I'm Matthias Endler, an open-source maintainer and Rust
consultant living in D&uuml;sseldorf, Germany.

I'm the founder of [corrode](https://corrode.dev), a Rust consulting company.
Before that, I was a backend engineer at [trivago].

My interests are scalability, performance and distributed systems, but I also
play around with embedded systems and console emulation. I hold an M.Sc. in
Computer Science from [Universit&auml;t Bayreuth].

Here is a list of my [public speaking][talks] engagements.
