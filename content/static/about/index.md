I'm a Backend Developer / Site Reliability Engineer living in DÃ¼sseldorf,
Germany.

My interests are scalability, performance and distributed systems; but I also
play around with embedded systems and console emulation.  I have a master's
degree in Computer Science from [Universit&auml;t Bayreuth].  At work, I improve
the backend infrastructure of [trivago] by making it faster and more reliable.

Nowadays, I mostly use _Golang_, _Python_, and _Rust_ to get stuff done.

## Side Projects

- [*Hello, Rust!*], a YouTube channel about the Rust programming language.
- [codeprints.dev](https://codeprints.dev) is a shop for art prints from your
  Github contributions to decorate your home-office.
- [analysis-tools.dev](https://analysis-tools.dev) is an open comparison
  platform for static/dynamic code analysis software, listing 500+ tools.
