Warm welcome to my blog! I'm Matthias Endler, an open-source maintainer and Rust
consultant living in D&uuml;sseldorf, Germany.

I'm the founder of [corrode](https://corrode.dev), a Rust consulting company.
Before that, I was a backend engineer at [trivago].

My interests are scalability, performance and distributed systems, but I also
play around with embedded systems and console emulation. I hold an M.Sc. in
Computer Science from [Universit&auml;t Bayreuth].

You can find me on [Twitter], [LinkedIn], [Stack Overflow], and [Github] or send
me an <a
href="mailto:&#109;&#097;&#116;&#116;&#104;&#105;&#097;&#115;&#064;&#101;&#110;&#100;&#108;&#101;&#114;&#046;&#100;&#101;&#118;">e-mail</a>.

Oh yeah, here is a list of my [previous talks][talks]. Let me know if you need a
speaker.
