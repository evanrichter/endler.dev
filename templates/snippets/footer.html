      <p>
        I'm <a href="/about">Matthias Endler</a>, a Backend Engineer at
        <a href="https://corrode.dev">corrode</a>, helping clients make their
        Rust code faster and more idiomatic. I maintain
        <a href="https://analysis-tools.dev/">analysis-tools.dev</a>, an open
        platform for static code analysis tools and
        <a href="https://github.com/mre/idiomatic-rust">Idiomatic Rust</a>.
        Previously, I ran
        <i><a href="https://hello-rust.show/">Hello, Rust!</a></i
        >, a YouTube channel about the Rust programming language and
        <a href="https://codeprints.dev">codeprints.dev</a>, a shop for printing
        your GitHub timeline. For more info, check out the
        <a href="/about">about page</a> or my
        <a href="/archive">blog archive</a>.

      <p>
        Some links on this blog are <i>affiliate links</i> and I earn a small
        comission if you end up buying something on the partner site (at no
        extra cost for you), which I use to cover maintenance costs. I only link
        to books and resources that I'd personally recommend to friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maintaining this blog and my projects is a lot of work and I'd love to
        spend a bigger part of my life writing and creating open source
        projects. If you like to support me in this goal, the best way would be
        to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/mre/">become a sponsor</a> ❤️.
